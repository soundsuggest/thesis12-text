%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%USE CASE 1
\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Use case 1 \textit{Hover item}}
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ l p{300px} } % l = left-aligned column; p{...px} = paragraph with specified width.
		\hline
		\textbf{Primary actor:}	& Active user \\
		\textbf{Preconditions:}	& The application has access to the active user's profile; \\
														& The visualization has successfully loaded; \\
		\textbf{Basic flow:}	& (1) The user enters the area of an item node in the graph; \\
													& (2) The system highlights the nodes and edges that are directly connected to the target node (popout technique); \\
													& (3) The system highlights icons next to the graph corresponding to neighbours that have the target item in their profile; \\
													& (4) The user exits the node area; \\
													& (5) The system shows the default layout of the graph; \\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%USE CASE 2
\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Use case 2 \textit{Hover neighbour}}

		\textbf{Basic flow:}	& (1) The user enters the area of a neighbour icon next to the graph; \\
													& (2) The system highlights the neighbour's icon; \\
													& (3) The system highlights the nodes and edges that connect items that are in the profile of the selected user; \\
													& (4) The user exits the icon area; \\
													& (5) The system shows the default layout of the graph; \\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%USE CASE 3
\begin{table}[h]

													& (2) The system highlights the nodes and edges that are directly connected to the target node; \\
													& (3) The system highlights icons next to the graph corresponding to neighbours that have the target item in their profile; \\
													& (5) The system displays additional information about the item and options in an area next to the visualization; information includes a brief introductory text and top tracks; options include the possibility to add the item to the active user's profile. \\
		
		\textbf{Alternate flow:}	& (2.a) the item was already selected: the item is now deselected; \\
